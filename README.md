# Rudimental_blog
This is a blog website that allows an admin to add images, title and description to the website via an admin panel. The images are then categorised into locations and group categories through which they can be filtered.

A user can view image details by clicking on the image. More images are shown on the gallery's page. Image categories allow a user to know what categories are available and location buttons allow a user to filter using locations.

Future releases to enable a user to create account and see their profile on what images the liked thus implementing user roles.
